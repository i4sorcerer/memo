### Transcript

- with more and more household waste being either incinerated or being buried underground, we'll be asking - is the recycling system broken?
- China used to accept 55% of the world's plastic and paper scrap. But in 2018 it stopped taking any more. Other countries like Indonesia and Vietnam took over China's waste processing role. But they too are now sending much of the scrap back, arguing it is contaminated and it is harming their own environments.
- The main problem comes from virgin plastic- original unused plastic containers. These are made directly from fossil fuels like crud oil or natural gas - major sources of carbon dioxide and climate change.
- And we have the slogan 'Reduce, Reuse and Recycling' 
- Recycling is unable to keep pace with the increase of virgin plastic production, so instead reducing and reusing plastic should be emphasised  - highlighted as being especially important.
